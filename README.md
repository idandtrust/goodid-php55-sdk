If you have PHP 5.6 or greater we suggest you to use https://github.com/idandtrust/goodid-php-sdk instead.

# GoodID SDK for PHP 5.5

This repository contains our open source PHP SDK that allows you to collect, decrypt and verify the data that you receive from the user.

## Installation

The GoodID PHP SDK can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Add the GoodID PHP SDK package to your `composer.json` file.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "goodid/goodid-php55-sdk": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

## Prerequisites
To provide GoodID login to your users, you need to first register at GoodID.
You will receive GoodID mobile app beta access, GoodID mobile app download link, client id, client secret, default keypairs and suggested claim-set. At this point you also had the chance to generate your own keypairs and send the public key to GoodID.

## The GoodID login flow
This is a short introduction to the GoodID login flow, to let you know what is the purpose of the endpoints that you will implement in the "Endpoints to be implemented" section.

Brief overview of the GoodID login flow:
1. When the user clicks on the "Login with GoodID" button, the GoodID Javascript SDK gets a new "OpenID Authentication Request" from your __GoodID Login Initiation Endpoint__ over AJAX.
2. The GoodID Javascript SDK opens the GoodID login page with the received "Authorization Request", where the user logs in using their phone.
3. The user is redirected to your __Redirect URI__ (Landing page), with "code" and "state" parameters that are used by the GoodID PHP SDK to collect, decrypt and verify the information provided by the user.
4. Congratulations! You have all requested data about the user. You can perform the login or registration process (if it is the first time they log in with the given subject identifier).

## Endpoints to be implemented

### GoodID Login Initiation Endpoint
The so-called __GoodID Login Initiation endpoint__ is a designated endpoint for GoodID. It is analogous to the OpenID Connect Login Initiation endpoint. Currently it is responsible for the following things: It generates the OpenID authentication request and makes possible the GoodID App-Initiated Login Flow (Login from providers screen, etc.).
The endpoint should be a separate PHP file (e.g. goodid-endpoint.php) with content similar to the below code snippet.
You don't have to handle GET/POST parameters, or write a response, this is all done automatically by the GoodID Endpoint that is instantiated in the code snippet.

```php
// GoodID Login Initiation Endpoint (e.g. goodid-endpoint.php)

// Load the SDK and other dependencies
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use GoodID\Authentication\GoodIDEndpointFactory;
use GoodID\Exception\GoodIDException;
use GoodID\Helpers\Key\RSAPrivateKey;
use GoodID\Helpers\OpenIDRequestSource\OpenIDRequestObject;
use GoodID\ServiceLocator;

// You have to start the session before using our SDK
session_start();

try {
    // Simply create and run our object, it will take care of everything
    GoodIDEndpointFactory::createGoodIDEndpoint(
        new ServiceLocator(),
        "YOUR-CLIENT-ID",
        new RSAPrivateKey("YOUR-SIG-PRIV-KEY-PEM-STRING"),
        new RSAPrivateKey("YOUR-ENC-PRIV-KEY-PEM-STRING"),
        new OpenIDRequestObject("YOUR-CLAIMS-JSON-STRING"),
        "YOUR-REDIRECT-URI"
    )->run();
} catch (GoodIDException $e) {
    error_log('Login initiation failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    http_response_code(500);
    echo "Internal Server Error";
}
```

### Redirect URI (Landing page)
You also have to handle the login requests of the user. When a user logs in with GoodID, they will be redirected to your so-called __Redirect URI__ with a "code" and a "state" parameter. You can use something similar to the below code snippet.
Doing a redirect after the login (attempt) is highly recommended as it removes the query parameters from the HTTP request URL, providing a cleaner experience for the user. It also keeps their browser history free of long expired authorization codes.

```php
// Redirect URI / landing page

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use GoodID\Authentication\GoodIDResponse;
use GoodID\Exception\GoodIDException;
use GoodID\Helpers\Key\RSAPrivateKey;
use GoodID\ServiceLocator;

// You have to start the session before using our SDK
session_start();

// If there is a "code" parameter, it must be a login attempt
if (filter_has_var(INPUT_GET, 'code') || filter_has_var(INPUT_GET, 'error')) {
    try {
        // The GoodIDResponse object collects, decrypts and verifies the response data
        $response = new GoodIDResponse(
            new ServiceLocator(),
            "YOUR-CLIENT-ID",
            "YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET",
            new RSAPrivateKey("YOUR-SIG-PRIV-KEY-PEM-STRING"),
            new RSAPrivateKey("YOUR-ENC-PRIV-KEY-PEM-STRING")
        );

        if($response->hasError()) {
            $error = $gidResponse->getError();
            $errorDescription = $gidResponse->getErrorDescription();
            // The login has failed with an OpenID Authentication Error Response
            // For example the user pressed cancel in the app
        } else {
            // Subject identifier
            $subjectIdentifier = $response->getSub();
            // The data provided by the user
            $claims = $response->getClaims()->toArray();

            // For debugging:
//          echo "Sub: $subjectIdentifier\n";
//          echo "Claims: ";
//          print_r($claims);
//          exit;

            // Now begins the substantial part of the job:
            // You can do your custom validation of claims.
            // You can log in (or register) the user:
            // Read/write your DB, regenerate session id, etc.
            // Good luck :-)
        }
    } catch (GoodIDException $e) {
        // The login has failed with an exception
        // The identity of the user cannot be verified
        error_log('Login failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    }

    header('Location: /');
    exit;
}
```

### Sending custom validation errors to GoodID
When a certain data is judged valid by the GoodID app, but your custom validation thinks that it is invalid, you might want to notify us.
With the information, we can make the validation better, or help you tune your claimset for better results.
You can send error logs to us in the following way:

```php
use GoodID\Helpers\Logger\RemoteLogger;
use GoodID\Helpers\Logger\Log;
use GoodID\ServiceLocator;

// Assume $response is a GoodIDResponseObject, as seen in "Redirect URI (Landing page)"
// And assume you have validated phone_number and billto.phone_number and they both had some errors.
try {
    if($response->hasAccessToken()) {
        $logger = new RemoteLogger(
            $response->getAccessToken(),
            new ServiceLocator()->getServerConfig()
        );
        $logger->log("phone_number", "Data does not conform to ...", Log::LEVEL_ERROR);
        $logger->log("billto.phone_number", "Data does not conform to ...", Log::LEVEL_ERROR);
        $logger->send();
    }
} catch (GoodIDException $e) {
    error_log('Remote logging failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

## Miscellaneous

These steps may be useful at certain steps of the integration.

### Generating your own keypairs

If you wish to generate your own keypairs, it is possible as follows, with openssl
Installing openssl for Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install openssl
```

Generating keypairs:

```
openssl genrsa -out client-enc_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in client-enc_key.pem -pubout > client-enc_key.pub
openssl genrsa -out client-sig_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in client-sig_key.pem -pubout > client-sig_key.pub
```

After that please send us the following:
- The new public keypairs (.pub files) and please label them so we know exactly to which environment they are for
- The request object created with the new public key for digital signature (based on the next paragraph)

### Generating a Request Object

As the last step of the integration you are required to send GoodID a signed default request object.
GoodID will publish this to the "request URI" hosted by GoodID, but created uniquely for you.
When a sign in process starts from the GoodID app we will get the request signed by you from there.
It can be generated as follows:

```php
use GoodID\Helpers\GoodIDServerConfig;
use GoodID\Helpers\OpenIDRequestSource\OpenIDRequestObject;

$requestObject = new OpenIDRequestObject("Your claimset as a JSON string");
$jwt = $requestObject->generateJwt(
    new RSAPrivateKey("The content of your sig.pem as a string"),
    "Your client id",
    "Your default redirect URI",
    new ServiceLocator()->getServerConfig()
);
echo $jwt;
```

### Using a picture returned in the `picture_data` claim

This is only interesting to you if you requested a picture from the user.
You don't have to write the image to a file, it is just an example.

```php
// Assume that $response is a GoodID response
$claims = $response->getClaims();
$f = fopen('temporary.jpeg', 'wb');
fwrite($f, base64_decode($claims->get('picture_data')));
fclose($f);
```
